  <h1>What are hamsters?</h1>
  <p>Hamsters are apart of the rodent family.  They were first found in Syria, but also live in countries such as Greece, Romania, Belgium, and Northern China.  In the wild, they live in warm, dry habitats but because they are prey animals, they survive longer in captivity as pets.</p>
