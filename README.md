  <h1>What are hamsters?</h1>
  <p>Hamsters are apart of the rodent family.  They were first found in Syria, but also live in countries such as Greece, Romania, Belgium, and Northern China.  In the wild, they live in warm, dry habitats but because they are prey animals, they survive longer in captivity as pets.</p>

  <h2>How to Care for a Hamster</h2>
  <p>When keeping a pet hamster, it is important to allow it to exercise, as hamsters are very active.  They need a wheel and/or a ball for running.  They eat many fruits and vegetables, pellets, and sunflower seeds, but it's important to research if there are any fruits or vegetables that hamsters shouldn't eat.  Their cages should be cleaned once a week or once every two weeks.</p>
